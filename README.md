# Docker Image Library jsonizer

Wanting to find a way to programmatically parse [Docker's Official Image Library tag output](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/tree/master/library), I built this parser to create a json that others can use for their own purposes.

# License

As this parser simply "reformats" files that exist in the [docker-library/official-images](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/) repository, the resulting JSON files that are generated in "Releases" are released via [Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/blob/master/LICENSE).

All code to create the JSON file is released via [AGPLv3](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/agpl-3.0).
